# Functional genomic data analysis: transcriptomics - Practical

This GitHUb directory is used to support the practical work of the course "Functional genomic data analysis: transcriptomics" 

You can have direct access to the content of the practical work for:
- [Microarrays](./Microarrays/README.md)
- [RNAseq](./RNAseq/TD_RNAseq.md)

You will work remotely on the [IFB-core Cluster](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/en/ifb-core-cluster/) manage by the French Institute of Bioinformatics (IFB), the national bioinformatics infrastructure that provides support, deploys services, organizes training and carries out innovative developments for the life sciences communities.

In order to connect to these ressources, you can read the following tutorials:
- [How to connect to the IFB server](IFBrstudio.md)
- [How to connect to the IFB Rstudio](IFBserver.md)
